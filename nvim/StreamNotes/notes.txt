Hey everyone! Today we are going to be working on some server functionality.
First things first though, I'm going to start implementing my database so I can store user data.
Nothing bad like tiktok or facebook though :).
Just usernames, passwords, userID and the date the user was created.
Also i have installed a new lsp for sql and a formatter to go with it so I need to set that up before i start.
Gonna take a quick break and grab some water ;)
Back now. Had a really good think about my project and honestly i think using websockets instead of TCP is better.
Purely just because websockets are more standard in the industry than something as low level as TCP.
Another quick break and some water :)
I'm back :)
Gonna end stream now guys, will be back either tonight around 10 or tomorrow night around 10.
See y'all later!
